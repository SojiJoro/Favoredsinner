2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Favored Sinner Website")
4. Copy the generated key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 3: Add to Environment
1. Open `.env.local`
2. Replace `your_resend_api_key_here` with your actual key
3. Save the file

### Step 4: Verify Email Domain (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to [Resend Domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Add your domain (e.g., favoredsinner.com)
3. Follow DNS verification steps
4. Update `FROM_EMAIL` in `src/lib/email.ts` if using custom domain

**Note:** See [EMAIL_SETUP.md](EMAIL_SETUP.md) for detailed email configuration.

## Social Media Links

Update social media URLs to match your actual accounts.

### Files to Update

- Line 216: Twitter URL
- Line 229: Instagram URL

**2. Contact Page** (`src/app/contact/page.tsx`)
- Line 165: Twitter URL
- Line 176: Instagram URL

### Example Update
```tsx
// Change from:
href="https://twitter.com/favoredsinner"

// To your actual handle:
href="https://twitter.com/YourActualHandle"
```

**If you don't have social accounts yet**, either:
- Remove the social links section from both files, or

## Content Customization

### Statistics (Optional)

The services page shows "50+ Projects" and "98% Client Satisfaction". To update:

**File:** `src/app/services/page.tsx` (lines 78-82)

```tsx
{ number: '50+', label: 'Projects Delivered' },    // Update number
{ number: '98%', label: 'Client Satisfaction' },   // Update percentage
{ number: '24/7', label: 'Support Available' },
```

### Testimonials

Three testimonials are displayed on the homepage. These are currently sample testimonials.

**To update:** Edit `src/app/page.tsx` (lines 325-513)

**Important:** Only use real testimonials with permission. Consider:
- Asking satisfied clients for feedback
- Anonymizing names if needed
- Starting with fewer testimonials if you don't have three yet

### Service Pricing

All service prices are defined in `src/data/services.ts`. Review and update as needed:
- Ensure prices match your actual rates
- Update service descriptions to match your offerings
- Adjust testimonials in service cards
